# Memo-Archiver
![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)
- 
This application is for note taking, and is deployed using the free version of render.

## Description

- My motivation for building this application was to create a note taking application called memo archiver that allows the client to take notes on their device.
- This project was built to assist the client with taking notes so they dont need a pen, and paper.
- This solves the problem of not being able to take notes conveniently.
- In this project, I learned that Express is a framework that enables me to concentrate on backend development seamlessly, without affecting the live deployment of the website.

## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, Node.js, NPM, Express, and Render. From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally in your device you can open VSCode. Lastly once VSCode is running open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), type npm install for the node_modules package, then type npm run start. Once you've done this the website will be deployed locally for testing, debugging, and developing.

## Usage

Take notes conveniently on your device at anytime with the Memo Archiver. Store your notes here safely, and check back when you want to see the saved notes.
